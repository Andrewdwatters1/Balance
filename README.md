## BALANCE 
Balance is our take on the popular Momentum Chrome Extension, and is a productivity centric SPA with a feature-rich UI and fully-integrated full-stack design.  The project was bootstrapped with the create-react-app CLI and a nodeJS backend.  

### Project Design: 
  Initial planning suggested that a SPA layout would be the most effective and engaging for a productivity focused application, so we decided to forego routing and create a fairly simple component architecture.  As the project's timeline was fairly constricted, we decided to start working towards an MVP which included a scratchpad/notes section, a nested to-do section, a calendar section, and a habit tracking section.  

### Project Functionality: 
  As the project progressed beyond our initial MVP, we opted to expand the functionality to include a basic pomodoro, weather display and news section. We also implemented basic endpoint and unit testing, leading a more test-driven development process as we neared completion.

### Project Tech: 
  One of our objectives in creating BALANCE was to continue exploring relevant 3rd party libraries.  As such, we opted to bring in the following tech: 
  - [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) JS library for global state management patterns
  - [Redux Promise Middleware](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-promise-middleware) Middleware library enabling more robust async handling in Redux
  - [MomentJS](https://momentjs.com/) JS library for date manipulation, validation and parsing
  - [MaterialUI](https://material-ui.com/) React UI framework to implement Google's Material Design
  - [React Infinite Calendar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-infinite-calendar) Mobile friendly, highly customizable calendar wireframe
  - [NodeCron](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-cron) NodeJS task scheduler module
  - [BcryptJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcryptjs/v/0.7.6) NodeJS library for password encryption/decryption
  - [Massive](https://massive-js.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) PostgreSQL database access tool
  - [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js
  - [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) Relational database management/query system
